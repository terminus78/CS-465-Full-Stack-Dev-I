CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

## Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

> In this project, I made a travel site with a front end for the customer and an SPA for the admin(s). Express, HTML using Handlebars, and JavaScript was very helpful in building the elements and pages necessary for the user-facing front end. For the admin SPA, I used Angular and TypeScript to build a card based system that showed each available trip and its associated data. Building the user page and the admin SPA were quite different. The routing and structure of the user page was much simpler and easier to build. The functionality of Angular was very powerful and took a bit to learn.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

> The NoSQL MongoDB database used in this project was helpful due to its schemaless nature. This made storing data very natural. It also would be helpful if this site were to expect to be scaled up greatly in the future. With MongoDB, we could use horizontal scaling.

## Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

> While JSON borrows elements of it, JavaScript is a full language where JSON is just a format for storing data based on JavaScript object syntax. JSON is used to store the data in the backend using MongoDB. This data can be passed to the front end for display.

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

> The user page was originally developed as static HTML and CSS with next to no functionality. Later in the class, I incorporated JavaScript, Express, and MongoDB to make the page interactive, capable of storing data, and able to be modified and maintained more easily.

## Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

> In a full stack application, methods are accessed through API endpoints. These methods should be secured from malicious actors through authentication and authorization, and accounting should be used to monitor user activity. Users should also only be given the minimum permissions and access necessary to accomplish the tasks they set out to achieve.

## Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

> This course has been instrumental in exposing me to web development and industry standard practices. I've now had the opportunity to utilize the MEAN stack in building a full-stack application. I have a more complete understanding of the front end, back end, and the interaction between each.
